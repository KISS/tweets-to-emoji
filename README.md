# Expressing Tweet Emotion as Emoji, and Detecting Violence

This repository contains Twitter data, in csv and json formats, made up of 36k tweets and 17 features. The dataset was created to build a classification model to help classify the emotion of a Tweet as anger, joy, fear, or sadness, and then output this classification as an Emoji. 

Future work for this project includes building (or acquiring) a corpus of text with content classified as "violent", and work on detecting violent or potentially violent Tweets for flagging. 

A presentation detailing the project is available at: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BF_v7UviBcaGRjsOArbECirm8xn_c-F12XtXv-mAvSc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BF_v7UviBcaGRjsOArbECirm8xn_c-F12XtXv-mAvSc/edit?usp=sharing). 

This project was submitted as part of my masters pattern recognition coursework.
